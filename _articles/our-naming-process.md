# Verbal identity development process

### Briefing
The brief is the most important document of every branding and advertising project, a document in which are resumed: the context of the project and the problem that needs to be solved.

First step of briefing is designated to identify the objectives of the naming project, its understanding from the perspectives of the business owner and of the namer. The client is introduced to the research field and the terminology, in order to be able to draw the naming guidelines of the project. After this, the client is asked to fill in the blank spaces of a briefing questionnaire. The expected answers should define the strategy which the new name has to accomplish, present the particularities of the company, its values, communication style, levels of interest in the domain, owner’s opinions and perspectives, the concepts that inspire and makes him/her happy, names considered relevant, names of competitors, media channels in which the name will appear and other special requests, if any. Before returning it to the naming specialist, the client has to sign the document with the answers.

### Research
The namer has to do research on the market field in which the client is involved, note the interesting aspects, the trends and the naming conventions already established – which have to be avoided.

An accurate analysis of competition’s strengths and weaknesses can reveal the actual position the client is/could be standing on. The namer has to identify direct and indirect competitors, specific terms and naming strategies.

### Development
After all the research, the necessary resources are prepared to start exercising on name proposals. The namer generates a generous list of idea-names, up to 100 items. This list can contain all sort of words, statements or symbols.

### Validation
The namer decides on keeping only 20 to 30 names from the list that are considered to be most intriguing. The resulting names and their modified forms are looked up on the market, through cultural and linguistic screens. Names are also evaluated with the relevance items and contextual use. Their potential usability to other markets is tested as well.

### Presentation
Ten of the most powerful names are presented to the client along with argumentations, slogans and perspectives (website address, e-mail, possible extensions). The client receives 3 testing tool also, on request.

The Chosen One is delivered in an “idea book” containing implementations, suggestions and a set of nomenclature standards.
